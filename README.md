<h2>Testing</h2>

During development I continuously user tested. I extensively used console.log to help me understand what my code was doing.
I recruited some testers to test my application on different application
I carried out testing on different devices.
I code checked on JSHINT which returned no errors.
I validated the markup and css code using: W3C Validator and Jigsaw Validator and return no errors
